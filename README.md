### Frontend Mobile/Web Developer & Coffee Addict ☕️

Hello! I’m a front-end developer from America. Originally, I was a 2D illustrator and animator, and have always had a strong interest in being creative. And that hasn’t changed, no matter if that's working frame by frame or coding line by line. 

My coding journey has taken me through the fun adventure of mobile and web development with alot of fun teammates along the way. I continue to grow and learn more everyday. Looking forward to working with even more developers from all around the world creating new and innovative applications together.
